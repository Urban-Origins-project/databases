# databases
This repository contains SQL code to recreate project databases. The scholarly data is freely available but if you use the data you should cite Christopher von Nagy, Mary D. Pohl, and Paul Schmidt-Schoenberg as authors unless otherwise noted. This data and associated software tools are an incidental repository for the Urban Origins project sponsored by the NEH and conducted under the auspices of FSU and UNAM. Copies of this data are deposited in the archives of these respective organizations and will be deposited at tDAR in the future. Any questions about this working repository should be directed to Christopher von Nagy at cvonnagy@unr.edu. Please note that this is not intended to be a complete archive but rather serves as a working central point for project members to exchange data.
